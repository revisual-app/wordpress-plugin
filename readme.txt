Revisual syncs with Google Calendar and more, letting you design and embed event widgets in WordPress via shortcodes or the Gutenberg Block Editor.

== Description ==

Revisual makes event management effortless. Sync your Google Calendar (or other supported calendars) and instantly create stunning, shareable event widgets. Embed them seamlessly into your WordPress site using shortcodes or the Gutenberg Block Editor. Your event updates happen in real-time — no manual changes needed!

With built-in customization, you can match your calendar’s look to your brand, highlight key events, and improve engagement with featured events and alerts. Plus, Revisual generates shareable QR codes and hosted event pages, making it easy to promote your events beyond your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin free? =

YES! Revisual is free to use. You don't need a paid plan to use the Revisual either. We offer a free plan that includes all the features you need to get started.

= How the plugin works, exactly? =

It's simple. Revisual WP plugin does not store any data on your server. It connects to your Revisual account and fetches the data from there. You can manage your events in your Revisual account and they will be automatically updated on your website.

= Why Revisual stores data on its server instead on my WP? =

Revisual stores data on its server to ensure that your events are always up-to-date. Revisual allows you to share your events on multiple websites and platforms. If the data was stored on your server, it would be difficult to keep all the events in sync.

= Do I need to use Revisual Plugin to make Revisual work? =

No. Revisual works on its own. You can use Revisual without the plugin. The plugin is just a way to make it easier to embed your events on your WordPress website.

= Can I customize the look of the widget? =

Yes! Revisual widget builder allows you to customize the look of your widget. You can change the colors, fonts, and more to match your brand.
