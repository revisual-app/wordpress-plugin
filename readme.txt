== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin free? =

YES! Revisual is free to use. You don't need a paid plan to use the Revisual either. We offer a free plan that includes all the features you need to get started.

= How the plugin works, exactly? =

It's simple. Revisual WP plugin does not store any data on your server. It connects to your Revisual account and fetches the data from there. You can manage your events in your Revisual account and they will be automatically updated on your website.

= Why Revisual stores data on its server instead on my WP? =

Revisual stores data on its server to ensure that your events are always up-to-date. Revisual allows you to share your events on multiple websites and platforms. If the data was stored on your server, it would be difficult to keep all the events in sync.

= Do I need to use Revisual Plugin to make Revisual work? =

No. Revisual works on its own. You can use Revisual without the plugin. The plugin is just a way to make it easier to embed your events on your WordPress website.

= Can I customize the look of the widget? =

Yes! Revisual widget builder allows you to customize the look of your widget. You can change the colors, fonts, and more to match your brand.
